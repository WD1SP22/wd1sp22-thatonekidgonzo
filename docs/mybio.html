       <h1>My main Goals and Dreams</h1>
       <p>My main goal in life has always been to pursue my passions and to do things as efficiently as possible.</p>
       <p>I continously improved recipes at work to increase the speed in which we make them without losing quality.</p>
       <p>In Momona I introduced the idea of putting the bao dough right by our steamer decreasing poofing time by half.</p>
       <p>In Grana I started experimenting with timing of the baking of the trart to achieve a beautifully yellow tart with no brown spots. I also played around with the order of bread making to go from only baking 1 type of bread to 3 (Ciabatta, Focaccia and Wheat Loaf Bread).</p>

     <section id="school">
       <h1>Education</h1>
       <p>As a first generation College student, I was very intimidated with college when I first started as no one in my family had attended it in the US and could explain to me the process.</p>
       <p>Because of this I struggled and dropped out to pursue another passion of mine: Food.</p>
       <p>When the world was affected by the Corona Virus I started to re-evaluate my life and ask myself if I was truly happy doing what I was doing.</p>
       <p>The answer to this was no as I wanted to live more confortably than Cooking/Baking allowed me to ontop of doing something that made me feel like I was making a difference and part of something bigger.</p>

       <h1>Travel/Adventure Life</h1>
       <p>Traveling has always been a passion of mine. When you start traveling you realize we are all the same and want the same thing.</p>
       <p>This knowledge opened my eyes and made me make so many connections between different cultures and my own.</p>
       <p>I have grown addicted to traveling and learning it is very intoxicating as every little thing you learn increases your knowledge and helps you think thigs through better and make better decisions.</p>
       <p>Traveling the world while working remote has always been a dream of mine that I am actively pursuing.</p>

     <section id="why">
       <h1>Why do I want to be a Programmer?</h1>
       <p>I want to do something challenging that really pushes me to keep my passion for learning active. What better way than programming?</p>
       <p>I want to learn more languages and better understand the true base of fundamentals to be the best programmer I can be. I really want to get to the point where I can be going over older code and refactoring to make it more efficient.</p>
       <p>In a podcast I listen to I heard a person talk about going around to companies refactoring their code to make their programs run more efficiently and consuming less electricity.</p>
       <p>This seems like such a needed and basic way to really help the environment, for if we have to be using these programs why not create a standard to go through them saving not only the company but the user in electricity usage benefiting everyone and the world in the process.</p>
